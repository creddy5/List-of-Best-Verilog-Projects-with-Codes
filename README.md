# List-of-Best-Verilog-Projects-with-Codes
This repository contains List of Verilog HDL projects showcasing various digital design and hardware modeling concepts. Each project includes well-documented Verilog code, testbenches, and READMEs to help understand simulation flow and design behavior.


| S.No | Project Name | Description |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | [TrafficLights_Controller_4Signals-8-States](https://github.com/creddy5/TrafficLights_Controller_4Signals-8-States) | Verilog code for a traffic light controller using 8 states to manage four-way traffic with precise transitions. |
| 2 | [TrafficLights_Controller_4Signals-4-States](https://github.com/creddy5/TrafficLights_Controller_4Signals-4-States) | Verilog code for a simplified 4-state traffic light controller that can be easily expanded for additional roads. |
| 3 | [Electronic_voting_machine_basic](https://github.com/creddy5/Electronic_voting_machine_basic) | Implements a digital Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Verilog HDL with candidate vote counting and reset features. |
| 4 | [Electronic_voting_machine_with_2_7Segement_Displays](https://github.com/creddy5/Electronic_voting_machine_basic) | Implements a digital Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using Verilog HDL that counts votes for multiple candidates and displays the results using two 7-segment displays per candidate. |
| 5 | [Asynchronous-FIFO-Verilog-Project](https://github.com/creddy5/Asynchronous-FIFO-Verilog-Project) | Implements an Asynchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory buffer in Verilog HDL, designed for data transfer between two independent clock domains â€” typically used in high-speed digital systems to prevent metastability and data loss.|
